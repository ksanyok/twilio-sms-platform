### 3.5 Template Variables

Message templates support dynamic variable substitution:

| Variable        | Replaced With       | Example      |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| `{{firstName}}` | Lead's first name   | John         |
| `{{lastName}}`  | Lead's last name    | Smith        |
| `{{company}}`   | Lead's company      | Acme Corp    |
| `{{phone}}`     | Lead's phone number | +12125551234 |
| `{{city}}`      | Lead's city         | Miami        |
| `{{state}}`     | Lead's state        | FL           |

**Example Template:**

```
Hi {{firstName}}, this is Sarah from SCL.
We noticed {{company}} might benefit from our credit lines.
Are you interested in learning more? Reply YES to continue.
```

**Spintax Support** (if enabled in Settings → System):

```
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{firstName}}, {interested in|looking for} a credit line?
```

This randomly selects one option from each `{option1|option2}` group per recipient, helping avoid carrier filtering.

### 3.6 Sending Speed & Throttling

The platform applies multiple layers of sending controls:

| Control                    | Description                                                | Default                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Sending Speed**          | Messages per minute per campaign                           | 60/min                              |
| **Per-Number Daily Limit** | Maximum messages a single phone number can send per day    | 350                                 |
| **Ramp-Up**                | Gradual daily limit increase for new numbers               | Day 1: 50, Day 7: 200, Day 21: full |
| **Jitter**                 | Random ±40% variation in send delays to appear natural     | 40%                                 |
| **Time Distribution**      | Spread messages evenly across the hour                     | Enabled                             |
| **Circuit Breaker**        | Auto-pause campaign if error rate exceeds threshold        | 30%                                 |
| **Delivery Throttle**      | Numbers with <80% delivery rate are capped at 50% capacity | 80%                                 |

## 4. Inbox

**Conversation List Features:**

### 4.2 Message Thread

When you select a conversation, the right panel shows the full message history:

- **Outbound messages** (you sent) appear on the right with an indigo background
- **Inbound messages** (lead replied) appear on the left with a dark border
- Each message shows:
  - Sender prefix ("You" for outbound)
  - Message body
  - Timestamp (h:mm AM/PM format)
  - Delivery status icon (✓ sent, ✓✓ delivered)
- The thread auto-scrolls to the newest message

### 4.3 Replying to Messages

1. Type your reply in the text area at the bottom of the thread
2. The **SMS Counter** below the textarea shows: `X/160 · 1 SMS` (see Section 4.6)
3. Press **Enter** to send, or **Shift+Enter** for a new line
4. The reply button is disabled if the textarea is empty

**Opt-Out Warning:** If a lead has opted out (sent STOP), a red banner appears above the textarea: "Cannot send messages — this lead has opted out." The reply input is disabled.

### 4.4 AI Draft Reply

If OpenAI is configured (Settings → Integrations):

1. Click the **✨ AI Draft** button (purple) above the textarea
2. The system sends the conversation context to OpenAI
3. A draft reply is generated and inserted into the textarea
4. Review, edit if needed, and send

The AI considers the conversation history, lead information, and context when generating replies.

### 4.5 Conversation Actions

The thread header provides several actions:

| Action                  | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mark Read / Unread**  | Toggle the read status of the conversation                                    |
| **Reassign**            | Transfer the conversation to another rep (dropdown of all users)              |
| **Mark Interested**     | Update the lead status to INTERESTED                                          |
| **Mark Not Interested** | Update the lead status to NOT_INTERESTED                                      |
| **Mark DNC**            | Mark lead as Do-Not-Contact (red, with warning). Prevents all future messages |

### 4.6 SMS Counter & Segments

The SMS Counter component appears in all message composition areas (Inbox, Campaigns, Automation):

**Display:** `X/160 · 1 SMS`

**How it works:**

- Standard SMS (GSM-7 encoding): 160 characters per segment

**Color coding:**

- **Gray** — 1 SMS segment (normal)

- **Red** — 3+ SMS segments (warning — higher cost)

If Unicode characters are detected, the counter shows a "· Unicode" indicator.

| **NOT_INTERESTED** | Gray    | Lead declined                                |
| **DNC**            | Red     | Do-Not-Contact — all messaging blocked       |

Statuses can be changed individually or in bulk. The system auto-updates status to CONTACTED when the first message is sent, and to REPLIED when an inbound message is received.

### 5.5 Tags & Management

Tags provide flexible categorization for your leads:

**Inline Tag Management (on the Leads table):**

- Existing tags appear as colored badges next to each lead
- Hover over a tag and click **×** to remove it
- Click **+** to add a tag — a dropdown appears with available tags
- Tags are created in Settings → Tags (see Section 10.1)

Each tag has a custom color, making it easy to visually identify categories at a glance.

### 5.6 Bulk Actions

1. Select leads using the checkboxes (or use the header checkbox to select all visible)
2. A blue action bar appears at the top with the selected count
3. Available bulk actions:
   - **Change Status** — Set all selected leads to a new status
   - **Start Automation** — Trigger an automation sequence for selected leads
   - **Suppress** — Mark selected leads as suppressed (stops messaging)
   - **Delete** — Permanently remove selected leads (requires confirmation)
   - **Clear** — Deselect all

### 5.7 Lead Detail Drawer

Click **"View Details"** from the lead's action menu to open a slide-out drawer with:

- Full lead information (all fields, editable)
- Conversation history with the lead
- Tag management
- Notes field
- Custom fields (JSON)
- Assignment to a rep
- Compliance status (opted out, suppressed, DNC)

## 6. Pipeline

### 6.1 Kanban Board

The Pipeline page provides a visual deal pipeline with drag-and-drop functionality:

- **Columns** represent pipeline stages (e.g., New Lead, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won)
- **Cards** represent leads/deals in each stage
- Drag cards between stages to update their progress
- Stages can be reordered by dragging the columns themselves

### 6.2 View Modes

Three view modes are available (persisted to localStorage):

| Mode                  | Description                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Columns** (default) | Kanban-style horizontal columns |
| **Grid**              | Card grid layout                |
| **List**              | Traditional table/list view     |

### 6.3 Managing Stages

**Creating a Stage:**

1. Click the **"+ Add Stage"** button
2. Enter: Stage name, color (color picker), and optional status mapping
3. Click **Create**

**Status Mapping:** You can link a pipeline stage to a lead status. When a card moves to that stage, the lead's status auto-updates. For example, mapping "Funded" stage to `FUNDED` status.

**Editing/Deleting:** Click the ⋮ menu on any stage header for Edit or Delete options. Deleting a stage removes all cards from it (leads remain in the system).

### 6.4 Card Management

Each pipeline card shows:

- Lead avatar and name
- Phone number
- Current lead status badge
- Company (if present)
- First 2 tags (with "+X more" indicator)
- Assigned rep
- Last activity timestamp

**Right-click a card** for quick actions:

- View Lead Details (opens detail drawer)
- Assign Rep (user selection list)
- Add Note (text modal, max 500 chars)
- Mark DNC
- Delete from Pipeline

### 6.5 Drag-and-Drop

The pipeline supports two types of drag-and-drop:

1. **Cards between stages** — Drag a card and drop it into a different stage column. The card's position and stage are updated instantly.
2. **Stage reordering** — Drag a stage column header to change the order of stages.

Both operations are saved to the server immediately with optimistic UI updates.

### 6.6 Filters & Search

Filter the pipeline view using the toolbar:

- **Search** — Filter cards by lead name, phone, or company
- **Tag Filter** — Show only cards with a specific tag
- **Rep Filter** — Show only cards assigned to a specific rep

Filters apply in real-time across all view modes.

## 7. Phone Numbers

> **Access:** Admin and Manager roles only

### 7.1 Number Overview

The Numbers page has two tabs: **Numbers** and **Daily Assignments**.

**Stats Cards (Numbers tab):**
| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Active | Numbers currently available for sending |
| Warming | Numbers in ramp-up phase |
| Cooling | Numbers temporarily paused |
| Suspended | Numbers flagged for issues |
| Avg Health | Average delivery rate across all numbers |
| Sent Today | Total messages sent across all numbers today |

**Header displays:** Total number count and today's capacity usage (e.g., "36/200 today").

### 7.2 A2P / 10DLC Compliance

The platform supports A2P 10DLC (Application-to-Person 10-Digit Long Code) registration:

- Numbers registered with a Twilio Messaging Service show a green **"A2P"** badge next to the phone number
- In the expanded row details, you'll see the **Messaging Service SID** and **"10DLC Approved"** label
- When sending, the system **prioritizes A2P-approved numbers** over non-registered ones
- If at least one A2P-approved number is available, non-approved numbers are excluded from the sending pool

**How to set up A2P/10DLC:**

1. Complete Brand registration in the Twilio Console
2. Submit a Campaign Use Case under the brand
3. Add phone numbers to a Messaging Service
4. Set `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID` in the platform's `.env` file
5. Run **"Sync Twilio"** on the Numbers page — the platform queries the Messaging Service and populates A2P status

### 7.3 Adding Numbers

**Single Number:**

1. Click **"Add Number"**
2. Enter the phone number in E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Optionally set: Friendly Name, Daily Limit, Enable Ramping
4. Click **Add Number**

**Bulk Import:**

1. Click **"Add Number"** → Switch to **"Bulk Import"** tab
2. Paste phone numbers (one per line)
3. Set common Daily Limit and Ramping preferences
4. Click **Import X Numbers**

**From Twilio:**

1. Click **"Sync Twilio"** to automatically import all numbers from your Twilio account
2. Numbers are matched by SID or phone number — existing numbers are updated, new ones are created
3. Numbers removed from Twilio are marked as RETIRED

### 7.4 Number Statuses

| Status        | Badge     | Description                                                               |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ACTIVE**    | 🟢 Green  | Available for sending. Messages can be routed to this number              |
| **WARMING**   | 🟡 Yellow | In ramp-up phase. Daily limit is gradually increasing                     |
| **COOLING**   | 🔵 Blue   | Temporarily paused (usually due to error streak). Auto-recovers after 24h |
| **SUSPENDED** | 🔴 Red    | Manually flagged. Requires admin intervention to reactivate               |
| **RETIRED**   | ⚫ Gray   | Permanently removed from rotation. No messages sent                       |

**Manual Actions:**

- **Cool** (❄ snowflake icon) — Temporarily pause an ACTIVE number for 24 hours
- **Activate** (▶ play icon) — Reactivate a COOLING, WARMING, or SUSPENDED number
- **Edit** (✏ pencil icon) — Change friendly name, daily limit, ramping, or status
- **Delete** (🗑 trash icon) — Permanently remove (with confirmation)

### 7.5 Ramp-Up Schedule

New phone numbers should increase sending volume gradually to build carrier reputation and avoid being flagged as spam.

When **Ramping** is enabled for a number:

- The daily limit follows a progressive schedule instead of using the flat daily limit
- Default schedule example: Day 1 = 50, Day 2 = 75, Day 3 = 100, ..., Day 21 = full limit
- The schedule is configurable in Settings → System → Ramp-up
- The "Ramp" column in the table shows `Day X` while ramping, or `Done` when complete

The ramp day advances automatically at midnight, and numbers that complete the schedule graduate to full capacity.

### 7.6 Cooling & Auto-Recovery

The platform protects your phone number reputation with automatic cooling:

**Auto-Cooling Trigger:**

- If a number reaches **5 consecutive errors** (error streak), it's automatically set to COOLING status
- The `coolingUntil` timestamp is set to 24 hours from the cooling event
- The reason is logged (e.g., "High error streak")

**Recovery:**

- At midnight, the daily reset job checks all cooled numbers
- Numbers whose `coolingUntil` has passed are automatically reactivated with `status = ACTIVE` and `errorStreak = 0`
- Alternatively, an admin can manually activate a number at any time

**Proactive Throttling:**

- Numbers with a delivery rate below 80% (configurable) are automatically throttled to 50% of their daily capacity
- This prevents underperforming numbers from degrading the overall sending reputation

### 7.7 Daily Assignments

The **Daily Assignments** tab lets you assign specific phone numbers to sales reps for the day:

**Summary Cards:**

- Reps with Numbers — Count of reps who have assignments
- Assigned Today — Total number→rep assignments active
- Unassigned Active — Active numbers not assigned to any rep

**Assigning Numbers:**

1. Click **"Assign Numbers"**
2. Select a **Sales Rep** from the dropdown
3. Check the phone numbers to assign (with search/filter)
4. View capacity summary (e.g., "3 numbers · 600 msgs/day")
5. Click **Assign**

**Rep Cards:** Each rep shows an expandable card with:

- Rep name and avatar
- Number count and usage bar (percentage of daily capacity used)
- Expandable list of assigned numbers with their status and sent/limit counts
- **Unassign All** button to remove all assignments for a rep

Assignments are **date-based** — they apply to the current day and new assignments should be made each day. When a rep sends a message, the system prefers their assigned number(s) for that lead.

### 7.8 Number Pools

Number pools allow you to group phone numbers for campaign-specific sending:

- Create pools in the Numbers page (shown as cards above the table)
- Each pool has a name, optional description, and active/inactive status
- Assign numbers to pools for reputation segregation
- When creating a campaign, select a number pool to send from
- Only numbers within that pool will be used for the campaign

### 7.9 Twilio Sync

The **"Sync Twilio"** button performs a comprehensive sync with your Twilio account:

1. Fetches all incoming phone numbers from Twilio
2. Queries the configured Messaging Service to check which numbers are registered for A2P/10DLC
3. For each number:
   - If exists locally by SID → Updates capabilities, name, and A2P status
   - If exists locally by phone number → Updates SID and metadata
   - If new → Creates with default settings (Active, ramping, 200/day limit)
4. Numbers in the local database that no longer exist in Twilio are marked as **RETIRED**
5. Cache is invalidated after sync

---

## 8. Automation

### 8.1 Automation Rules

The Automation page manages rule-based messaging workflows:

**Stats Cards:**
| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Active Rules | Count of enabled rules out of total |
| Total Steps | Sum of all template steps across all rules |
| Active Runs | Count of currently running automation sequences |

Each rule is displayed as an expandable card showing:

- **Enable/Disable toggle** — Immediately activate or deactivate the rule
- **Rule name** and **type badge** (color-coded by trigger type)
- **Summary metadata:** step count, run count, send window hours, weekend status
- **First template preview** with delay indicator

### 8.2 Trigger Types

| Trigger                | Badge Color | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LEAD_CREATED**       | Blue        | Fires when a new lead is added to the system                       |
| **STATUS_CHANGED**     | Yellow      | Fires when a lead's status changes (configurable: to which status) |
| **KEYWORD_RECEIVED**   | Purple      | Fires when an inbound message contains specific keyword(s)         |
| **NO_REPLY**           | Orange      | Fires when a lead hasn't replied after X days                      |
| **MANUAL**             | Dark/Gray   | Only triggered manually by a user (via Leads → Bulk Actions)       |
| **TAG_RULE**           | Emerald     | Fires when a specific tag is applied to a lead                     |
| **FOLLOW_UP_SEQUENCE** | Cyan        | Multi-step follow-up sequence with configurable delays             |

### 8.3 Template Sequences

Each automation rule can have multiple **template steps** sent in sequence:

```
Step 1 (Day 0) → "Hi {{firstName}}, are you interested in..."
    ↓ wait 2 days
Step 2 (Day 2) → "Hey {{firstName}}, just following up..."
    ↓ wait 3 days
Step 3 (Day 5) → "Last chance {{firstName}}! Our offer expires..."
```

Each step has:

- **Sequence Order** — Step number (1, 2, 3...)
- **Delay Days** — How many days to wait before sending this step
- **Message Template** — The SMS body text (supports all template variables)

**Auto-pause on reply:** When a lead replies during an automation sequence, the run can be configured to pause automatically, preventing further follow-ups from being sent.

### 8.4 Schedule Constraints

Every automation rule has sending window controls:

| Setting              | Default  | Description                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Send After Hour**  | 9:00 AM  | Earliest time messages can be sent |
| **Send Before Hour** | 8:00 PM  | Latest time messages can be sent   |
| **Send on Weekends** | Disabled | Whether to send on Saturday/Sunday |

Messages scheduled outside these windows are held and sent when the window opens.

### 8.5 Managing Rules

**Creating a Rule:**

1. Click **"New Rule"**
2. Configure: Name, trigger type, trigger settings, send window
3. Add one or more template steps with delays
4. Save as active or inactive

**Rule Actions:**

- **Expand** — View all steps and configuration details
- **Duplicate** — Create a copy of the rule with a new name
- **Edit** — Modify all rule settings and templates
- **Delete** — Permanently remove the rule (with confirmation)

## 12. Technical Reference

### 12.1 SMS Sending Modes

The platform supports three sending modes, configurable in Settings → System:

| Mode            | Config Value  | Twilio API        | Delivery          | Cost           | Use Case            |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| **Live**        | `live`        | Production client | Real delivery     | Charged        | Production use      |
| **Twilio Test** | `twilio_test` | Test client       | No delivery       | May be charged | Integration testing |
| **Simulation**  | `simulation`  | None              | Simulated locally | Free           | Development/Demo    |

**Simulation Mode Details:**

- Generates fake Twilio SIDs (format: `SM_SIM_xxxxxxx`)
- Simulates a 50–150ms sending delay
- Message marked as SENT immediately
- Useful for testing the full campaign flow without any Twilio interaction

### 12.2 Sending Engine Architecture

The platform uses a queue-based architecture for reliable message sending:

```
Campaign Start / Inbox Reply / Automation Trigger
    ↓
SendingEngine.queueMessage() or queueBulkSend()
    ↓
[Compliance Check] → Skip if STOP/DNC/Suppressed/Opted-out
    ↓
[Find Best Number] → Round-robin rotation, A2P preference, ramp-up limits
    ↓
[Create Message Record] → Status: QUEUED
    ↓
[Add to BullMQ Queue] → Redis-backed, with priority
    ↓
Worker picks up job
    ↓
SendingEngine.sendViaTwilio()
    ↓
[Twilio API call] → Using Messaging Service SID (A2P)
    ↓
[Update Message] → Status: SENT, SID stored
    ↓
[Twilio Webhook callback] → Status: DELIVERED or FAILED
```

**Bulk Optimization:** For campaigns with thousands of leads, the engine batches operations:

- Single compliance check (fetch all STOP numbers once)
- Batch conversation creation
- Batch message record insertion
- Bulk queue addition
- Result: ~10 database queries for 10,000 messages (vs ~50,000 without batching)

### 12.3 Number Rotation Algorithm

The system uses intelligent number rotation to distribute load and protect reputation:

1. **A2P Priority** — If any numbers have `messagingServiceSid` set (A2P-approved), only those are used
2. **Daily Limit Check** — Numbers at their daily limit (accounting for ramp-up) are excluded
3. **Delivery Rate Throttling** — Numbers with <80% delivery rate are throttled to 50% capacity
4. **Round-Robin Selection** — From the remaining eligible numbers, selection rotates evenly
5. **Sticky Sender** — For reply conversations, the same number is used for continuity
6. **Rep Assignment** — If a rep has numbers assigned, their messages prefer those numbers

### 12.4 Compliance & Quiet Hours

The platform enforces multiple compliance layers:

| Layer                | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **STOP List**        | Numbers that sent "STOP" — automatically opted out          |
| **DNC Status**       | Leads marked as Do-Not-Contact — all messages blocked       |
| **Suppression List** | Manually uploaded phone numbers — all messages blocked      |
| **Opted Out**        | Leads who explicitly opted out — all messages blocked       |
| **Quiet Hours**      | No messages sent between configured hours (default 8PM–9AM) |
| **Business Hours**   | Optional additional window for automation only              |

All compliance checks happen **before** a message enters the sending queue. Blocked messages are recorded but never sent.

### 12.5 Webhook Configuration

Configure these webhook URLs in your Twilio Console for each phone number or Messaging Service:

**Message Status Callback:**

```
https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/twilio/status
```

Method: POST  
Purpose: Receives delivery status updates (sent → delivered, failed, undelivered)

**Inbound Message Webhook:**

```
https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/twilio/inbound
```

Method: POST  
Purpose: Receives incoming SMS messages from leads

**Important:** Both webhooks must be publicly accessible. The platform processes these callbacks to:

- Update message delivery status in real-time
- Create inbound message records
- Update conversation timestamps and unread counts
- Trigger automation rules (keyword-based)
- Update phone number delivery statistics
